title: I've just learned Rust and I think I'm in love
---

I've decided to learn some Rust during the last weeks along working on the [Stanford's experimental course on operating systems](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140e/).

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

That's how the language is described on [its website](https://www.rust-lang.org). Here's a list of things that I think are great about it.

### Rust employs many innovative concepts that make sense

There are many things that make this language stand out in the crowd and they all make sense when you think about them in the scope of Rust's main goal - a safe alternative for systems programming. Things such as [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html), [borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html), [slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-03-slices.html), [modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html), [lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch10-00-generics.html) - just to name a few.

### It has a built-in package manager
